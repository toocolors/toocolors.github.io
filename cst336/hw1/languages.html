                    In addition to their type, each programming language specializes in one or more tasks.
                    They may focus on broad concepts such as simplicity or speed, 
                    or they may focus on specific fields such as data science.

                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    Python is a high-level, interpreted language that is known for being readable and easy to learn.
                    It features extenstive library support, as well as a large and active community.
                    It is commonly used for AI, data science, and web development.
                    <br><br>
                    Python is known for executing slowly, due to it being an interpreted language.
                    <br><br>
                    Python is notable for its easy to read syntax, which often features symbol English.
                    It also omits semi-colons in favor of using white-space to designate pieces of code.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="div_box div_languages">
                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    Java is an object-oriented language. 
                    It is known for being easy to port to other hardware, 
                    which allows it to be used in a wide variety of environments.
                    <br><br>
                    Java is known for being verbose, which can make writing programs and maintenance challenging.
                    It is also known for its slow startup times.
                    <br><br>
                    Instead of compiling to specific hardware, Java uses the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
                    which is able to run compiled Java code on a variety of hardware.

                <h2>C</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    C is a compiled language that is known for its fast execution. 
                    It is used in operating systems, embedded systems, game engines,
                    and many other programs that require efficient execution.
                    <br><br>
                    C lacks many modern features that other languages have.
                    This makes errors and mistakes more easy to occur in C.
                    <br><br>
                    C is often called the mother of all programming languages as many other languages
                    have borrowed syntax or features from it.

            <div class="div_box div_languages">
                <h2>SQL</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    SQL is a specialized language designed managing databases.
                    Similar to Python, it features easy to read syntax that makes it easy to learn.
                    It is used anywhere where databases are used, making it common in many areas.
                    <br><br>
                    Because SQL is so specialized, it is incapable of performing many tasks.
                    Integration with other programming languages is required.

                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    HTML is a mark-up language used to structure content on web pages.
                    The majority of websites rely on HTML in combination with CSS and JavaScript.
                    Because of this, HTML is a very common and popular language. 
                    It is also used in moble app development.
                    <br><br>
                    HTML doesn't support logic, interactivity, dynamic content, or advanced styles on its own.
                    It relies on other languages, namely JavaScript and CSS, to deliver these services.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="div_box div_languages">
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    JavaScript is a high-level language, interpreted language used for designing web applications.
                    It is able to integrate with HTML to make robust, interactable websites
                    and web applications.
                    <br><br>
                    To ensure compatability with older web browsers, servers, and websites,
                    JavaScript retains several bugs and other quirks.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite its name, JavaScript has very in little in common with Java.

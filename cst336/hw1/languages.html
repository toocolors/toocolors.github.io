                    In addition to their type, each programming language specializes in one or more tasks.
                    They may focus on broad concepts such as simplicity or speed, 
                    or they may focus on specific fields such as data science.

                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    Python is a high-level, interpreted language that is known for being readable and easy to learn.
                    It features extenstive library support, as well as a large and active community.
                    It is commonly used for AI, data science, and web development.
                    <br><br>
                    Python is known for executing slowly, due to it being an interpreted language.
                    <br><br>
                    Python is notable for its easy to read syntax, which often features symbol English.
                    It also omits semi-colons in favor of using white-space to designate pieces of code.

            <div class="div_box div_languages">
                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    Java is an object-oriented language. 
                    It is known for being easy to port to other hardware, 
                    which allows it to be used in a wide variety of environments.
                    <br><br>
                    Java is known for being verbose, which can make writing programs and maintenance challenging.
                    It is also known for its slow startup times.
                    <br><br>
                    Instead of compiling to specific hardware, Java uses the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
                    which is able to run compiled Java code on a variety of hardware.

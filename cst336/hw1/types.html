                    Overtime, programming languages have developed into several different types
                    to suit different goals.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples of different types includes:

                    This page is going to briefly cover the different types of programming languages,
                    their strengths, and their weaknesses.

                <h2>Low-Level Lanaguages</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    Low-level languages can be thought of as being closer to the machine.
                    They execute quickly, use less resources and have direct access to hardware.
                    However, they require extensive knowledge of the hardware, are prone to errors,
                    and are difficult to move to different hardware.
                    They are best used on small tasks that require precision or speed.
                
                    <br><br>
                    Examples of low-level languages include:

                <h2>High-Level Lanaguages</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    If low-level languages are closer to the machine, then high-level languages are closer to the human.
                    They are more readable, make errors easier to find and prevent, and are easier to port to different hardware.
                    They are also slower than low-level languages, and require more resources.
                    They are useful for large-scale projects.

                    Examples of high-level languages include:

                <h2>Compiled Lanaguages</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    Programs written in compiled languages need to be compiled before they can be ran.
                    Compiling a program involves turning it into machine code using software known as a compiler.
                    Compiled programs run quickly, but any changes that that are made must be recompiled to have any effect.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples of compiled languages include:
                </p>
                    <ul class="list_left">
                        <li>C</li>

                        <li>C#</li>
                        <li>COBOL</li>

                <h2>Interpreted Lanaguages</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    A program written in an interpreted language does not need to be compiled ahead of time.
                    Instead, its instructions are interpreted into machine code during run-time.
                    This enables changes to the program to take effect without needing to be recompiled.
                    However, interpreted programs run slower than compiled programs.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples of interpreted languages include:
                </p>

                        <li>Python</li>

                <h2>Object-Oriented Lanaguages</h2>
                <p class="p_box">
                    Object-oriented languages use pieces of data called classes and objects.
                    Classes are pieces of data that perform a certain function. 
                    Classes hide their data, and show only the necessary data to the outside.
                    Objects are instances of a class.
                    Object-oriented programming helps improve security, code reusability, 
                    and ease of development and maintenance.

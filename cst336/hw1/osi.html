                    How is data sent from a computer, through the internet, to another computer? 
                    Today, the internet uses the OSI Model.<br><br>
                    The OSI Model has seven layers:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Physical Layer</li>
                        <li>Data Link Layer</li>
                        <li>Network Layer</li>
                        <li>Transport Layer</li>
                        <li>Session Layer</li>
                        <li>Presentation Layer</li>
                        <li>Application Layer</li>
                    </ol>
                    Each layer helps data move across the internet, and relies on the layer below it to function.

        <div>
            <h2>The Physical Layer</h2>
            <p>
                The Physical Layer is responsible for sending and receiving individual bits.<br>
                When it receives a bit, it forwards it to the Data Link Layer.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The Data Link Layer</h2>
            <p>
                The Data Link Layer ensures that data is transfered from one node to another without errors.<br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The Network Layer</h2>
            <p>
                The Network Layer helps transmit data between two hosts that are located in different networks.<br>
                It is in charge of routing data inbetween different hosts and networks.<br>
                Devices such as routers and switches are commonly used to implement the Network Layer.
                
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The Transport Layer</h2>
            <p>
                The Transport Layer ensures communication between two different hosts.<br>
                It further helps ensure that data is transfered to the correct application, on the correct host.<br>
                It also features extra features, such as flow control, which helps keep data flowing smoothly.<br>
                Common protocols in this layer include TCP and UDP.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The Session Layer</h2>
            <p>
                The Session Layer helps manage communication sessions between two hosts.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The Presentation Layer</h2>
            <p>
                The Presentation Layer manipulates data from the Application Layer to ready it for network transmission.<br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The Application Layer</h2>
            <p>
                The Application Layer functions as a point of access for applications to access the network.

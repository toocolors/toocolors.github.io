            <h2>Introduction to Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>
                Computers have taken over the modern world.
                They are used in every field imaginable, for every task imaginable.<br>
                They are able to do this, in part, 
                because of the programming languages that are used to give them instructions.

                <br><br>
                Countless languages exist.
                Some aim to provide speed, while others provide robust features.<br>
                Some are designed for small or focused programs,
                while others are designed to tackle large-scale projects.

                <br><br>
                This website aims to give an overview of the different types of languages,
                some examples of specific languages, and some examples "Hello World" programs,
                a simple program used to show some of a language's syntax.
